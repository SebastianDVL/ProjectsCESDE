  <hr>
  <p>Owning a genuine grand piano is a special privilege for those who do. Many people save their money for years to purchase this
     type of piano. These instruments are finely crafted, and their price tag will match that amazing craftsmanship. This is most
      certainly a luxury item; however, it is one that a pianist will be able to put to good use. These fine pianos are perfect for
       live performances and composing, so a serious musician is going to adore owning one of these.There are 7 different classifications
        of grand pianos based on size.  While the usual terms are grand vs. baby grand piano, in actual fact, they are the same type of
         piano but vary in size.  Here are the different piano sizes.<br><br>

       Piano Sizes (grand piano classifications)<br><br>
       
       What distinguishes the different grand pianos is the length of the piano which ranges from 4.5′ to 9′.  Check it out.<br><br>
       
       
       Petit grand: 4′ 5″ to 4′ 11″<br>
       Baby grand: 5′ to 5.5′<br>
       Medium grand: 5′ 6″ to 5′ 8″<br>
       Professional grand: 5′ 9″ to 6′ 2″<br>
       Parlor grand: 6′ 3″ to 6′ 10″<br>
       Semi-concert grand: 6′ 11″ to 7′ 8″<br>
       Concert grand: 8′ 11″ to 9′<br><br>
       
       As you might expect, a grand piano is quite large. This isn’t going to be a practical choice for many people, 
       as it will take up a significant amount of space. The price tag on this type of piano can be prohibitively expensive for many
        people, as well. If you are a casual piano player, this fancy, a finely crafted piano may not appeal to you at all.
        <br><br>
       
       A grand piano does have several advantages over an upright model, though. For instance, you can make
        use of the double escapement mechanism to play keys in rapid succession when you use one of these pianos. 
        That mechanism isn’t built into an upright piano, meaning that certain musical techniques are possible on
         this piano that would not apply to the upright models. This is one of the many reasons that people who love 
         pianos want to own the grand piano above all others.
         <br><br>
       
       Professional musicians or people who simply have an extreme passion for piano are going to be the
        likely buyers of this item. The sound that comes out of a finely crafted grand piano is simply superb.
         It is capable of creating some of the most emotional tones possible, so, to many, it will be worth the hefty price.
          This particular grand piano is hand-crafted and looks absolutely stunning.
       
          <br><br>
       
       The beautiful look of a grand piano is part of the appeal as well. It is a sight to behold, and this is one reason that
        you will see performers using these types of pianos at large concerts. Legendary musicians such as Elton John perform
         on grand pianos, and the grand piano assists these musicians in creating a spectacle that can be enjoyed by the masses.
          Your reasons for wanting one might be more subtle, but you’ll love owning it if you’re a true piano aficionado.</p>

  <h4>Upright Pianos</h4>
  <hr>
  <p>Upright pianos are among the most common types of pianos on the market. They are commonly seen in churches in the United States.
     An upright piano can more easily fit into someone’s home or a building than its larger sister, the grand piano. 
     They are not necessarily small; they just aren’t as large or wide as grand pianos.    <br><br>

     You can fit an upright piano right up next to a wall very conveniently. This allows you to put the piano in the corner 
     of a room and keep it out of the way. These pianos are less desirable for live stage performances, as the pianist will
      have difficulty seeing the crowd or being seen by the crowd. In this case, the pianist would be staring at a wall or 
      the piano itself. These pianos are mostly used in homes, in schools, or to provide music for church services.    <br><br>

     The biggest difference between an upright piano and a grand piano is that the strings and the action are vertical 
     in the upright version of this instrument. As a result, the piano functions completely differently from a grand piano,
      and it will feel different from a grand piano when you play it. If you have grown accustomed to playing on one without
       experiencing the other, then you might be quite shocked to feel the difference for yourself. You can play both in the
        same fashion, for the most part, but an upright piano is going to have a unique feeling when you hit the keys.    <br><br>
     
     There are many different styles and sizes of upright pianos on the market. You will find some that are very tiny and 
     others stand pretty tall. Most of the time, people prefer to buy upright pianos that are somewhere in the mid-range of
      the sizes available. These pianos are a little bit more affordable than grand pianos, but they are still expensive instruments.    <br><br>

  <h4>Electronic Pianos</h4>
  <hr>
  <p>Although many people out there don’t consider digital pianos to be real pianos at all, they definitely have their role in the 
    piano world. They work differently from a traditional piano, but they can have a similar sound. Some prefer to classify digital
     pianos as keyboards, but they do replicate the feeling and the tones produced by traditional pianos. Digital pianos have come
         a long way in recent years, and this piano is a good example of a high-quality digital music instrument.<br><br>

         When you are playing a sophisticated digital piano, you will feel as if you are playing on a traditional piano.
          It replicates the feel of the hammers hitting the keys quite nicely. They designed the keys on this piano to have
           a weight to them in order to make it feel as close to the real thing as possible. Although it differs from a 
           traditional piano, it is much more affordable which makes it a great option for many.<br><br>

         The existence of pianos like this helps people to have access to pianos. Many more people are able to play the piano 
         because of the accessibility of the digital piano. In order to pass this instrument down to future generations, it is 
         sensible that manufacturers will continue to make highly functional digital pianos like this. It is more accessible to people,
          and it is a superb tool for teaching young people to learn how to play.
          <br><br>
         Some digital pianos even have connectivity with smart devices. This allows you to access certain functions of the piano
          and to play around with the settings. You can also record your music sessions so that you can listen back to hear how well 
          you are doing. There are conveniences that come along with owning a digital instrument like this that you cannot enjoy with
           traditional models.

  <h4>Studio Pianos</h4>
  <hr>
  <p>Studio pianos are fairly large and they stand between 43” and 47” on average. For this reason, they are more commonly found in
     studio environments than they are in people’s homes. Some people will purchase studio pianos for their homes because they
      have grown accustomed to the size and feel of these instruments. Professional musicians who are comfortable with the upright
       style of pianos will gravitate towards this model.      <br><br>

       The most common use for these pianos is music composition. When people are trying to come up with melodies or are playing
        around with different musical ideas, they often use a studio piano. They are perfect for helping musically talented 
        individuals work through their creative process. Having one in your home would prove very beneficial if you want to 
        be able to produce your own music in your home.
        <br><br>
As with many types of pianos, you can choose between acoustic studio pianos and digital studio pianos. A digital model is
 going to be much more affordable. As a result, it has become the most commonly used. Digital studio pianos are very reasonably 
 priced so you will be able to purchase one for your studio or your home without spending too much of your hard-earned money.
